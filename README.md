# dijkstra
Implementation of dijkstra's algorithm in Python - Output includes network graph and shortest path. Output screenshots attached.

- It takes node inputs from text files and creates a networkx graph
- It also takes in a dictionary and calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm

Thank you
